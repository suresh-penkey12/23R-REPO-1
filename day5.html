    <i><p>The software development lifecycle is a workflow pipeline that combines the following steps to create high-quality software: Design, Document, Program, Test, and Maintain.</p>
    <p>The process usually begins with a requirements-gathering phase where stakeholders provide input on the software application. A software project description should start with an overview that explains the type of software, the problem it will solve, and the benefits to the business and users. The overview should focus on the final product and its benefits, rather than the technical aspects of the project.</p></i>
    <h2 align="center">Software Development Technologies</h2>
    <p>There are many different types of software development technologies available, each with its own strengths and weaknesses.Some of the most popular technologies in software include:</p>
